    <p>I am from Malad City, Idaho. I grew up with nine other siblings, and I fall in at number 7. I enjoy trying
        new things and experiences. My favorite thing to do is seek out new types of food to try. I served a mission
        in the Washington Seattle mission, where I had a cool opportunity to serce as a Mandarin-speaking missionary
        and learned about the Chinese culture.</p>
    <p>I got back in 2019 and attended some BYU Pathway program, then transferred to BYU Idaho to explore an in-person 
        experience. I met my wife while working at Walmart. Later, I learned she had a crush on me for a while and even 
        attempted writing her phone number on a hot chocolate cup. I didn't notice; after all, that stuff only happens 
        in movies. Now, we have a baby girl on the way and are looking forward to that new experience.
